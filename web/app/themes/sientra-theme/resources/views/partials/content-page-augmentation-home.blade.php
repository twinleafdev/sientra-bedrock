  		  <h2>Is your plastic surgeon board-certified?</h2>
  		  This is the first criteria to consider when researching a surgeon. Not all surgeons who perform breast augmentation are board-certified. Board-certification requires the highest level of surgical training and education and, as a result, is shown to minimize complications related to breast surgery.3 
  ONLY Sientra implants are available exclusively through board-certified plastic surgeons. You can trust if a surgeon offers Sientra, they are board-certified.
