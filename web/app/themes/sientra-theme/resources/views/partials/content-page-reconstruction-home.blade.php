	<p>Breast reconstruction is a surgical procedure that restores the shape and appearance of a breast. You may consider breast reconstruction following a mastectomy or a lumpectomy.</p>
	<p>The most common approach is implant-based reconstruction which uses a breast implant to rebuild breast shape.1 </p>
	<p>Breast reconstruction can either be performed in a one-step procedure, often referred to as direct-to-implant, where the implant is inserted at the time of your mastectomy. Or, more commonly, the reconstruction takes place in two steps.1 </p>
